## Findings

Of 1055 "no take" zones, >1000 never saw any fishing effort between 2012 and 2020.

27 of the \~50 with effort were implemented since 2012; about 10 of those showed
a significant decrease in effort, 15 or so only had pretty marginal amounts of
fishing effort, and I'd say 2 had high amounts of effort inside the areas even
after being implemented.


### Criteria for inclusion:
 - total amount of fishing effort *and* percentage of 
 fishing effort among affected ships decreased
- one or both of these decreased by at least 20%
